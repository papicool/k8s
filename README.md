1.1 Understanding Cloud Computing

- In this lesson I would like to tell you about cloud computing. So what is it all about? Well, cloud has emerged as a standard platform for running applications, where in the old days you will be running your applications directly on top of an operating system. Now the cloud has taken over much of the functionality of an operating system. And doing so brings multiple benefits. For one, the underlying platform is easily scaled. So if you need more capacity, you can easily add capacity, as it's available virtually unlimited in cloud. Also because of the scalability of the platform the application itself can be scaled easily, manually, as well as automatically. So if suddenly the demand on your web shop triples, well you can have a configuration that automatically triples the availability of your application as well. Cloud can be offered as a worldwide platform and that ensures that applications are accessible anywhere. And nowadays that so many companies are providing access to their application on smartphone platforms, it's just a perfect solution to make sure that no matter where on the world your users are, they can use your application. And also, applications don't have a direct relation with any specific server. That's what call decoupling. And that's a benefit, because it means that if your server goes down your application can still continue functioning. Now, cloud as search offer stateful APIs and that allows new IT strategies such as DevOps and GitOps and CI/CD. These are strategies that you may have heard about and which we'll see to some extent in further lessons in this course. Also, cloud offers standardization and that makes it easy to deploy applications on no matter which platform. So let's talk about cloud computing some more. In public cloud, resources can be hired as needed and the cloud provider takes care of the underlying infrastructure. So that means that you don't need an IT department anymore you just need a public cloud platform. In private cloud, a company can use its own infrastructure to offer cloud services. And regardless which type of cloud is used, behind the cloud are always physical or virtual servers hosting the application workload. But again, the physical or virtual service are decoupled. As a user of cloud, you don't deal with them directly anymore. And the result is that the application also doesn't have any relation with the service anymore. And that's a big thing in Kubernetes. We will see it throughout the course. To facilitate all of this, the cloud must offer facilities to store application resources in cloud. And that is something you'll learn more about in the next couple of lessons.


1.2 Running Applications in Cloud


- So what is the challenge in a cloud environment? Well, the cloud is something untouchable, right? And the thing with cloud is that you are running on different servers but these servers are kind of invisible. It's really the cloud that your application is going to interact with. So if you have your application right here it must be using resources that are in the cloud in a decoupled way. Decoupled means that the application cannot have a direct relation with the server. Now, there is a small challenge because applications need site specific information. Think of environment variables, think of configuration and challenges? How are we going to store all of that in the cloud? Well, that is what is provided by the Cloud API. The Cloud API defines different

1.3 Why Containers Make Sense in Cloud Environments


  - In this video, we'll talk about a role of containers in cloud environments. So to start with, let's talk about microservices which are closely related to containers. Microservices allow for efficient application development and maintenance. In microservices, different application components are connected to each other, and the individual microservices components are offered as containers. So what exactly is a container? Well, a container is started from an image. And the image is configured with the default application. That's what we call the entrypoint application. Inside the image, all libraries that are needed to start the application are included. And to run a container, you will need a container runtime. The container runtime is a platform-independent component that is use certain containers. Runtimes are standardized in a container runtime interface, also known as a CRI. And commonly used container runtimes are containerd and cri-o. Runtimes allow containers to be started on any operating system or cloud platform. And if you are using Kubernetes, the runtime is integrated in Kubernetes. If you are using standalone containers such as Docker or PopMan, the runtime is integrated in either Docker or PopMan. But using a runtime, it's a foundation for running containers in a Kubernetes environment.
